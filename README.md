**Lift Controller**


In the Given project to implement the Designing of an Lift controller that
uses the LCD to show the floor name with up arrow and down arrow depending
upon the rotation direction of the motor controller.
The 8051 microcontroller is a classic, 8-bit microcontroller that was first
introduced in 1980 by Intel. It is based on Harvard architecture and has the
following key features: 8-bit CPU with a clock frequency up to 24 MHz 128
bytes of on-chip RAM 4 KB of on-chip ROM (sometimes expandable with
external memory) 32 I/O lines 2 16-bit timer/counters 5 interrupt sources Full
duplex UART serial communication interface The 8051 architecture is
instruction set compatible across different manufacturers, meaning that the same
code can be used on 8051 microcontrollers from different manufacturers. This
has helped make the 8051 a popular choice for embedded systems projects.

PERIPHERALS:
The basic peripherals used for this program is:
1) 8051 MICROCONTROLLER
2) LCD Display (Used to display the direction )
3) SEVEN â€“ SEGMENT DISPLAY(used to display the floor position)
4) MOTOR CONTROLLER( Upon input rotate the motor in given direction
  for required number of times)
5) KEYPAD(used for taking input)
6) DAC(used to convert the Digital signal to Analog for motor control)
